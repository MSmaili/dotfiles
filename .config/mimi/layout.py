"""Resident mimi layout: dwindle BSP or workspace-wide overlapping stack.

JSON lines in/out; standard library only. State belongs to mimi, per Space and
screen. No subprocesses or disk writes per request. Stack windows overlap and
rely on macOS raising the focused window. No drag interpretation or insertion
hints are added.

Read from render() first, then follow the state, command, geometry and tree
sections. Command and Geometry hold request-local inputs, not persistent state.
Tree nodes remain the original JSON dictionaries; no object conversion is needed.

render() owns and mutates the supplied state. Inputs must contain unique window
IDs and a valid, acyclic tree. This refactor preserves valid-input behavior, not
an untrusted-input boundary: malformed input still raises, and the JSON codec
still has its own nesting limits despite the iterative tree operations.
